# <Random-Password-Generator>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a randomized secure password with imput from the user. The project was built to make a secure password. It solves the problem of thinking of passwords and creating passwords that could be easily guessed.I learned how to implement functions that call upon arrays, add prompts for users to answer, and how to implement the (NaN) and (cancat) tags.
